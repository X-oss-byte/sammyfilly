## Introduction

You only need a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository to create and run a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

The following example shows you how {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

## Creating your first workflow

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in  your repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} if this directory does not already exist.
1. In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `github-actions-demo.yml`. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)."
1. Copy the following YAML contents into the `github-actions-demo.yml` file:

   ```yaml copy
   name: GitHub Actions Demo
   {%- ifversion actions-run-name %}
   run-name: {% raw %}${{ github.actor }}{% endraw %} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
   {%- endif %}
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     Explore-GitHub-Actions:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a {% raw %}${{ github.event_name }}{% endraw %} event."
         - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a {% raw %}${{ runner.os }}{% endraw %} server hosted by GitHub!"
         - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {% raw %}${{ github.ref }}{% endraw %} and your repository is {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %}."
         - name: Check out repository code
           uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
         - run: echo "üí° The {% raw %}${{ github.repository }}{% endraw %} repository has been cloned to the runner."
         - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
         - name: List files in the repository
           run: |
             ls {% raw %}${{ github.workspace }}{% endraw %}
         - run: echo "üçè This job's status is {% raw %}${{ job.status }}{% endraw %}."
   ```

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. Then, to create a pull request, click **Propose new file**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Commit new file" area of the page.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-commit-new-file.png)

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the `push` event and runs your workflow.

## Viewing your workflow results

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
1. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to display, in this example "GitHub Actions Demo."

   ![Screenshot of the "Actions" page. The name of the example workflow, "GitHub Actions Demo", is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-workflow-sidebar.png)
1. From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see, in this example "USERNAME is testing out GitHub Actions."
1. In the left sidebar of the workflow run page, under **Jobs**, click the **Explore-GitHub-Actions** job.

   ![Screenshot of the "Workflow run" page. In the left sidebar, the "Explore-GitHub-Actions" job is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-job.png)
1. The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

   ![Screenshot of steps run by the workflow.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-logs.png)

   For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
   ![Screenshot of the "List files in the repository" step expanded to show the log output. The output for the step is highlighted with a dark orange highlight.](/assets/images/help/repository/actions-quickstart-log-detail.png)

The example workflow you just added is triggered each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} can work with the contents of your repository. For an in-depth tutorial, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)."

  - repo: https://github.com/sourcery-ai/sourcery
    rev: v1.6.0
    hooks:
      - id: sourcery
        # The best way to use Sourcery in a pre-commit hook:
        # * review only changed lines:
        # * omit the summary
        args: [--diff=git diff HEAD, --no-summary]
       * task : [--removeheader-of anyrepo] suggestions [new header]
       * replace old header with new after merging <replacing operation needs to be done manually>
To review all changes compared to the main branch:

args: [--diff=git diff main, --no-summary]
If you want Sourcery to automatically apply the suggested changes,add the --fix option:

args: [--diff=git diff HEAD, --fix, --no-summary]
By default, pre-commit executes its hooks in multiple processes in parallel. This can lead to multiple summaries displayed. For this reason, it's recommended to use the --no-summary option in pre-commit hooks.

The --diff option was introduced in version 0.12.11
The --no-summary option was introduced in version 0.13.0
If Sourcery is the first pre-commit hook that you've added to your project, you'll also need to run pre-commit install.

Notes
Initializing the environment for the Sourcery pre-commit hook might take some minutes.
When the Sourcery pre-commit hook runs for the first time, you might be prompted to log in to Sourcery. Run the sourcery login command as described in the CLI docs. For further runs of the Sourcery pre-commit hook, this login step isn't necessary .

VERCEL_GIT_PROVIDER
The Git Provider the deployment is triggered from. In the case of GitHub, the value is always github.
VERCEL_GIT_REPO_SLUG
The origin repository of the app on GitHub. Example: my-site.
VERCEL_GIT_REPO_OWNER
The GitHub organization that owns the repository the deployment is triggered from. Example: acme.
VERCEL_GIT_REPO_ID
The ID of the GitHub repository the deployment is triggered from. Example: 117716146.
VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF
The GitHub branch that the deployment was made from. Example: improve-about-page.
VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA
The GitHub SHA of the commit the deployment was triggered by. Example: fa1eade47b73733d6312d5abfad33ce9e4068081.
VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE
The message attached to the GitHub commit the deployment was triggered by. Example: Update about page.
VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_LOGIN
The GitHub username belonging to the author of the commit that the project was deployed by. Example: johndoe.
VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME
The GitHub name belonging to the author of the commit that the project was deployed by. Example: John Doe.
VERCEL_GIT_PULL_REQUEST_ID
The GitHub pull request id the deployment was triggered by. If a deployment is created on a branch before a pull request is made, this value will be an empty string. Example: 23.
We require some permissions through our Vercel for GitHub integration. Below are listed the permissions required and a description for what they are used for.

We use the permissions above in order to provide you with the best possible deployment experience. If you have any questions or concerns about any of the permission scopes, please contact Vercel Support.
To sign up on Vercel with a different GitHub account, sign out of your current GitHub account.

Then, restart the Vercel signup process.

Missing Git repository
When importing or connecting a GitHub repository, we require that you have Collaborator access to the corresponding repository, so that we can configure a webhook and automatically deploy pushed commits.

If a repository is missing when you try to import or connect it, make sure that you have Collaborator access configured for the repository. For an organization or a team, this page explains how to view the permissions of the members. For personal GitHub accounts, this page explains how to manage access.

Silence GitHub comments
By default, comments from the Vercel GitHub bot will appear on your pull requests and commits. You can silence these comments in your project's settings:

From the Vercel dashboard, select your project
From the Settings tab, select Git
Under Connected Git Repository, toggle the switches to your preference
If you had previously used the, now deprecated, github.silent property in your project configuration, we'll automatically adjust the setting for you.

It is currently not possible to prevent comments for specific branches.
Using GitHub Actions
You can use GitHub Actions to build and deploy your Vercel Application.

vercel build allows you to build your project inside GitHub Actions, without exposing your source code to Vercel. Then, vercel deploy --prebuilt skips the build step on Vercel and uploads the previously generated .vercel/output folder to Vercel from the GitHub Action.
